# Poker Rust

This repository contains an implementation of Poker Hand comparisons in Rust.

I'm just using this to experiment with the Rust language.

# Setup

If you don't have `rustup` installed, please run

```
sudo snap install rustup
```

Once you have `rustup`, if you don't have Cargo, then you can install the stable version of Cargo with

```
rustup toolchain install stable
```

# Running the project

Run with `cargo run`
